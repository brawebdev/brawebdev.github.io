  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p>My name is Winter Sky Arnold. This website was designed by my awesome husband, Benjamin Arnold, to help showcase my various art projects and endeavors.  I have many creative outlets such as painting, sketching, making wreaths, refurbishing furniture, and sewing projects.  All of the items in the gallery are past projects that are not for sale, but if you contact me I would be willing to recreate or custom make something for you. Enjoy!</p>
  <h4>About the Artist</h4>

  <img src="img/face.jpg">

  <p>I am a current student at Ivy Tech Community College working on my degree in Medical Laboratory Technology; I graduate in May 2017!!! I am 21 years old. I have been married to the man of my dreams, Benjamin Arnold, for 3 years.  My passions in life are bacteria (AKA my future job), reading, and letting my creative side get the best of me.  Art is definitely a way I relieve stress and have fun.  The pieces on my website can range all the way back from high school to now.  I hope you enjoy my stress reliever! </p>
